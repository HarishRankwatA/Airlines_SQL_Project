# Airlines Project using SQL & SQLite  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline operations using **SQL queries on a SQLite database** within a **Jupyter Notebook**.  
It demonstrates how to extract insights from flight, passenger, ticket, and revenue data through structured queries.  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- **Flight Analysis**: Number of flights, routes, and schedules.  
- **Revenue Insights**: Total and average ticket revenue by aircraft type.  
- **Passenger Data**: Distribution of passengers and ticket bookings.  
- **Seat & Aircraft Details**: Number of seats per aircraft, aircraft utilization.  
- **SQL Operations**: Joins, grouping, aggregations, and subqueries.  

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used
- **SQLite** â€“ Database engine  
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** â€“ Query execution & analysis  
- **Pandas** â€“ Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** â€“ Data visualization (if used)  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Files
- `Airlines_Project_using_SQL.ipynb` â€“ Main notebook containing SQL queries & analysis  
- `sample_airlines.db` â€“ Sample SQLite database (demo version, smaller than original)  

## ðŸ“‚ Database Schema (Sample)
Key tables in the database include:  
- **Flights** â€“ Flight ID, aircraft code, departure/arrival info  
- **Tickets** â€“ Ticket ID, booking details, passenger info  
- **Boarding_Passes** â€“ Ticket + seat assignment per flight  
- **Seats** â€“ Seat number, aircraft code, seat type/class  
- **Aircrafts** â€“ Aircraft model, total seats, configuration  

## ðŸ“· Example Queries & Outputs
- **Total Revenue by Aircraft**  
- **Average Ticket Price per Flight**  
- **Number of Seats per Aircraft Model**  
- **Passenger Ticket Distribution**
